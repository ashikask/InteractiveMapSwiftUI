# InteractiveMapSwiftUI
An innovative SwiftUI-based application that provides a detailed, interactive map experience. The app showcases how to integrate MapKit with SwiftUI, manage different device size classes, and utilize reusable components for a smooth and engaging user interface. It is designed to adapt seamlessly between iPhone and iPad layouts

## Features

- **Map Integration:** Leverages MapKit to provide dynamic and interactive map views.
- **Location Details:** Displays detailed location information with smooth transitions and animations.
- **Reusable Components:** Modularized code to ensure reusability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable layouts for both compact (iPhone) and regular (iPad) size classes.
- **Animated Transitions:** Smooth transitions between different views and state changes.
- **Gesture Interaction:** Tap and gesture-based interaction to update map regions and details dynamically.

## Address Breakdown

The application includes a feature called "Address Breakdown" where the address is broken down into its constituent components such as street, city, state, zip code, and country. Each component can be selected, and the map or image will dynamically update based on the selected part of the address. This is particularly useful for detailed navigation and understanding of how different parts of the address correlate with geographical locations on the map.

### Breakdown Example:
- **Street:** One Apple Park Way
- **City:** Cupertino
- **State:** California
- **Zip Code:** 95014
- **Country:** United States
Selecting any of these components will focus the map or imagery on that particular location.
